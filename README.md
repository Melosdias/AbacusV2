# AbacusV2
## What is it?
Basically, this is a calculator.<br />
First made for a first-year project, I took it over for a second-year project to fix some bugs and add a user interface.
## How to setup it?
Simply clone, open it in your favorite IDE and run it.
## How to use it?
You just have to write you expression in the corresponding area.<br />
I invite you to read the user manual accessible from the main menu to discover all the features.
